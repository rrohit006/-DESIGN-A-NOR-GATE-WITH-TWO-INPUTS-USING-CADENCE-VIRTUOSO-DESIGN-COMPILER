Design a NOR gate with two inputs including creating a schematic, symbol and layout for fabrication. The schematic will illustrate the circuiting, the symbol will represent it in diagrams and the layout will depict physical placement of component on a chip. This process ensure accurate representation & functionality of the NOR gate in electronic system.
